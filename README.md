## LeetCode Challange

It is important in solving algorithms as much as making projects. So I set myself a goal. Whenever I have a chance, 
I will solve algorithm questions over LeetCode and share them under this repo. I will try to solve easy problems until 
I get used to it. I'll be listing the names of the problems I was able to solve below.

### LEETCODE - EASY

* Two Sum
* Palindrome Number
* Roman to Integer
* Longest Common Prefix
* Valid Parentheses

### CODERBYTE - EASY

* Vowel Count
* Swap Case
